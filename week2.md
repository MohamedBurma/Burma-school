    1.Go to ide.cs50.io and click “Sign in with GitHub” to access your CS50 IDE.
    2.Submit Readability.
    3.Submit one of: 
        .Caesar if feeling less comfortable
        .Substitution if feeling more comfortable

**When to Do It**

By 11:59pm on 31 December 2020.

**Advice**

  -Try out any of David’s programs from class via Week 2’s source code.
  -If you see any errors when compiling your code with make, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking help50 for help. For instance, if trying to compile hello, and
    make readability
    
is yielding errors, try running

    help50 make readability
    
instead!
