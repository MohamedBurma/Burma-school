**When to Do It**

By 11:59pm on 31 December 2020.

**Advice**

  -Try out any of David’s programs from class via Week 5’s source code.
  -If you see any errors when compiling your code with **make**, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking **help50** for help. For instance, if trying to compile **hello**, and 
    
    make speller
    
   is yielding errors, try running
   
    help50 make speller
      
    
instead!
