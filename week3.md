**What to Do**

    1.Submit Plurality.
    2.Submit one of: 
        .Runoff if feeling less comfortable
        .Tideman if feeling more comfortable
        
If you submit both Runoff and Tideman, we’ll record the higher of your two scores.
        

**When to Do It**

**Advice**

  -Try out any of David’s programs from class via Week 3’s sandboxes.
  -If you see any errors when compiling your code with make, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking help50 for help. For instance, if trying to compile plurality, and 
    
    make plurality
    
   is yielding errors, try running
   
    help50 make plurality
      
    
instead!
